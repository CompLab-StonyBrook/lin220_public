    "This project is aimed at students who feel that they could benefit significantly from going over the notebooks a few more times.\n",

    "Then pick 3 units (which may include the recap units), and for each one of their notebooks add the following:\n",

    "1. A list of questions you have about the subject matter. This can include clarification, things you're curious about that are not covered there, and so on.\n",
    "   Any question is a good question.\n",

    "1. Concrete improvements.\n",
    "   For instance, if you think you know what a passage means but also think that it is worded poorly, provide a different phrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lots of practice exercises, with solutions.\n",
    "   The exercises should be short (comparable to LIN 120 exercises).\n",
    "   The solutions should be comparable to the solutions handed out for assignments in this class.\n",
    "   That is to say, they shouldn't just contain the answer, but also explain why this is the answer, what alternative solutions are and why they're better or worse, and why some solutions that students might try don't actually work.\n",
