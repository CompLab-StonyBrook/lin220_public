    "Python is a very high-level programming language, which is why some call it a *scripting language* in contrast to \"proper\", heavy-weight programming languages like Java or C.\n",
    "Python is not as fast as these languages, but it is just as powerful while making it much easier to write code in.\n",
    "When **fast coding** is more important than **fast code**, Python is a good choice.\n",
    "That's generally the case for data analysis, and increasingly so in computational linuistics, too.\n",
    "This makes Python the ideal language for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook gives a quick summary of some Python basics (corresponding to units 100-105 of LIN 120).\n",
    "Whereas the LIN 120 notebooks have detailed explanations in plain English, this summary is much more concise.\n",
    "It is assumed that you have enough of a programming background to quickly pick up the core ideas from a few code snippets."
