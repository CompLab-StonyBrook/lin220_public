    "**Finite-state automata** (FSAs) are a valuable upgrade.\n",
    "They can be used for part-of-speech tagging, stemming and lemmatization, word prediction, and so on.\n",
    "FSAs can do everything an n-gram model can do, and more.\n",

    "So why use n-gram models if FSAs are so much better?\n",
    "Well, FSAs are more powerful, but they are also harder to work with.\n",
    "Their implementation is a bit trickier, and they are much harder to learn automatically from corpora.\n",
    "The last part is often the most important for language technology, so n-gram models are preferred because learning is so straightforward with them (just compute the n-gram counts).\n",
    "\n",

    "What's a node, and what is an arc?\n",
    "Just like with prefix trees, our actual data structure will differ quite a bit from the intuitive depicition.\n",

    "\n",
    "> An FSA consists of three components.\n",
    "> 1. a unique initial state `I`,\n",
    "> 1. a set `F` of final states,\n",
    "> 1. a set `T` of transitions, each one of which is of the form `(current_state, label, new_state)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, our toy automaton above is mathematically described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "I = 1\n",
    "F = {4, 5}\n",
