    "Fixing errors comes with the risk of unwanted assumptions, though.\n",

    "1. Don't make hidden fixes.\n",
    "   For instance, it might be tempting to just skip ill-formed transition triples while processing the rest.\n",

    "1. Don't expect much of the user.\n",

    "For our `fsa`, one reasonable solution might look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep the `assert` lines inside `update` since there is no easy way to figure out what the intended input was.\n",
    "1. Add an additional `sanity_check` method that checks for a few telltale signs of malformed user input.\n",
    "   This includes:\n",
    "   - There is no transition from the initial state(s) to any of the other states.\n",
    "   - There is no transition to a final state.\n",
    "   - Some states are unreachable.\n",
    "1. Add an optional `verbose` parameter to `__init__` that, when set to `True`, displays the specified automaton as a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you an imagine, options 2 and 3 take quite a bit of work, so we won't try to tackle them here.\n",
    "In the real world, though, we don't have the luxury of skipping sanity checks if they're too much work.\n",
