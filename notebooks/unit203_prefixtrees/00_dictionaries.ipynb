    "- **Fast search**: Can items be retrieved quickly even if the data structure is very large? For small data structures (less than a couple thousand entries), this usually does not matter in practice.\n",

    "### Hash maps\n",

    "You should now have a better idea of what all the different data structures are and how they differ from each other.\n",
    "But our initial question still remains open: why are sets and dictionaries so much faster than lists when it comes to look-up?\n",
    "The answer lies in the key-value architecture.\n",
    "Remember, a set is essentially a dictionary where each value is its own key.\n",
    "Therefore, sets also follow the key-value architecture even though it is not readily apparent.\n",
    "The key-value architecture allows us to get around major shortcomings of the index-architecture used by lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a list, there is no easy way of telling the position of an item.\n",
    "If we want to know if `some_list` contains `foo`, there is no obvious starting point.\n",
    "Just about any index could contain `foo`.\n",
    "We have to go through the list from left to right until we find `foo` (if the list is ordered, there are some shortcuts, but the basic problem remains).\n",
    "This necessarily means looking at many items that are not `foo`, wasting time.\n",
    "The central problem is that there is no direct connection between an item and its position in the list, and thus the only safe option is an exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key-value architecture works very differently.\n",
    "It can be used to define a **hash map**.\n",
    "Without going too much into the math, the hash map provides a mechanism for converting keys to indices.\n",
    "In a loose sense, a dictionary is a list with a function that converts the key to the index of the item in the list.\n",
    "Returning to our previous example, suppose that our item `foo` were accessible under the key `bar`.\n",
    "The dictionary basically takes `bar`, runs it through the hash map to get back some value, say, 17.\n",
    "It then immediately retrieves `some_list[17]`, giving us `foo`.\n",
    "The whole process doesn't really involve any search at all.\n",
    "We never search through `some_list`.\n",
    "Instead, we immediately get the correct index from the hash map and immediately retrieve the desired item from the list.\n",
    "Metaphorically speaking, the hash map is a bit like an address book where we can use an item's key to look up its index.\n",
    "But as all metaphors, this is not quite right because an address book is itself a list, whereas a hash map is more like a system of rules for mechanically transforming a key into an index.\n",
    "Be that as it may, the bottom line is easy: search in dictionaries (and sets and Counters) is fast because it does not involve any actual searching."

    "### A limitation of hash maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash maps define a way of converting a key to the address where the corresponding value can be found.\n",
    "But since this is a mechanical process that operates solely on the shape of the key, any change to the key would also change the address that is returned by the hash map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a concrete example (again ignoring all the math that's going on under the hood).\n",
    "Suppose we have a dictionary `ex_dict` with a fixed hash map *h*.\n",
    "We want to add the value `\"I'm here\"` to `ex_dict`, and we use the key `bad_choice`.\n",
    "Our key `bad_choice` is a list of the form `[\"a\"]`.\n",
    "Based on this key, *h* computes a specific address for our value `\"I'm here\"`, and Python stores the value at this address in our dictionary `ex_dict`.\n",
    "Let's say this address is 17.\n",
    "Now, whenever we want to get the value for the key `bad_choice`, Python runs the key through the hash map *h*, determines that the output is 17, and returns the value at address 17 in `ex_dict`.\n",
    "So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at a later point, we append `\"b\"` to `bad_choice`, so that it now is `[\"a\", \"b\"]` instead of just `[\"a\"]`.\n",
    "The next time we try to get the value for the key `bad_choice`, the hash map *h* returns a different value because the key has changed.\n",
    "Instead of 17, we now get, say, 23.\n",
    "This is because the hash map is a mechnical translation from key shapes to addresses.\n",
    "If the shape of the key changes, so does the address.\n",
    "But now we have the wrong address, and all of a sudden we no longer get our desired value `\"I'm here\"`.\n",
    "Instead, we get whatever is stored at address 23 (which might be nothing at all).\n",
    "Changing the key has broken the whole dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this example shows, hash maps only work if keys cannot change.\n",
    "This is why Python requires that the keys of a dictionary must be **hashable**.\n",
    "The next notebook will explain in detail what this means.\n",
    "For now, the only hashable data types we know are numbers and strings.\n",
    "So all dictionary keys must be numbers or strings.\n",
    "**Keys cannot be lists, sets, counters, or dictionaries** (however, values are not restricted in this way)."
