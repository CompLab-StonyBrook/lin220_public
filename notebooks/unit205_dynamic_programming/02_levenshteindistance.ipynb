    "# Computing the Levenshtein distance\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in the lecture materials, the **edit distance** between two strings `s` and `t` measures the shortest sequence of edits that transforms `s` into `t`.\n",
    "Depending on what kind of edits are allowed, one obtains different metrics.\n",
    "For the Levenshtein distance, three kinds of operations are allowed: substitution, deletion, and insertion.\n",
    "Computing the Levenshtein distance is an optimization problem.\n",
    "That is to say, it's not enough to find some sequence of edits, one has to find the shortest one.\n",
    "Optimization problems can be very challenging.\n",
    "The naive approach would be to look at all possible sequences of edits and then pick the shortest one among them.\n",
    "But this is very inefficient, and just like with our `fibonacci` function the inefficiency stems from the fact that  many sequences of edits would share parts that would be needlessly recomputed with each new sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, any implementation of the Levenshtein distance needs to use dynamic programming techniques.\n",
    "The rest of this notebook assumes that you already know the graph-based approach covered in the lecture notes.\n",
    "If you don't, go back and reread that part.\n",
    "Once you understand how it works, come back and we'll see how it can be implemented in Python."
