    "# Dynamic programming and memoization\n",

    "In class we looked at the Levenshtein distance between two strings and how it can be computed efficiently with dynamic programming.\n",
    "Dynamic programming comprises two key techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Break down large problems into small problems.\n",
    "1. Store the solutions to small problems so that they do not have to be recomputed (**memoization**).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of you have actually used dynamic programming before.\n",
    "In grade school, you probably had to solve equations like `5 + (3 * 4) - (4 * (2 + 1))`.\n",
    "After a few exercises like that, you realized that it's easier if you don't just try to solve that in one fell swoop.\n",
    "Instead, you broke it down into smaller problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `3 * 4` is `12`.\n",
    "- `2 + 1` is `3`.\n",
    "- `4 * 3` is the same as `3 * 4`, so you can just reuse the `12` you've computed before.\n",
    "- `12 - 12` is `0`.\n",
    "- `5 + 0` is `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit will cover how dynamic programming can be used in Python with dictionaries.\n",
    "The first notebook (i.e. this one) will introduce recursive functions as an example of where memoization can greatly improve your code's efficiency.\n",
    "The second notebook then explains how memoization works, and the last one applies these techniques to the Levenshtein distance."
